Description
------------
This is my first major program I'm currently creating with Android. I used Android Studio to create the design, and programmed each button to function. It can use the basic addition, substraction, multiplication, and division, as well as
displaying integers (E.g. Negative numbers). I also created an icon for the project using Adobe Photoshop. Although it is not complete yet and I plan on adding more features to this calculator.
